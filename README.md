# FileShrinker
This program takes in two text files ("new" and "old") and generates a text file consisting of Add and Copy instructions
that replace the new file.
Also included is a program to create a text file using an instruction file.

This instruction file is significantly smaller than either the new or old files.

For example: 

warandpeace1 is the old file - 75.5 kb 

warandpeace2 is the new file - 75.5 kb

warandpeace3 is the instruction file -  403 b

warandpeace4 is the constructed new file - 75.5 kb

Instead of sending the new file, send the instruction file and have the recipient construct the new file.
This saves the sender from having to send the entire new file.
This program is especially useful if the new file is similar to the old file.
